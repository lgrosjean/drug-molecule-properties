# ðŸ’Š Drug Molecule Properties Forecasting

The goal of this project is to predict drug molecules properties with Deep Learning. 

## Quick start


*This process supposes that you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ "Anaconda homepage") (or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html "Miniconda homepage")) already installed, with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git download page").*

To install current project locally and access it, first clone the project (do not copy the `$` symbol, it only indicates that they are terminal commands):  
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/lgrosjean/drug-molecule-properties.git
$ cd drug-molecule-properties
```

Next, run the following to create Anaconda environment:
```shell
$ conda create -y --name myenv python=3.6
$ conda activate myenv
```

Then, install depencies:
```shell
(myenv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, build local project into a propre Python package:
```shell
(myenv) $ pip install . -U
```

*Check your installation*

```shell 
(myenv) $ python
```
```python
>>> import smiley
>>> print(smiley.__version__)
"0.0.2"
```

To have a better understanding of the package and how to play with your models, please follow [this documentation](play.md).
